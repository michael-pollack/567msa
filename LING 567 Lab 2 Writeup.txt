Standard Arabic is described to have two frequent word orders; VSO and SOV. When the subject is definite as marked with the definite marker  ‘al-’, the other permutations are also possible,  although the SOV and OSV orders are marginally acceptable. For basic clauses with intransitive verbs with definite subject NPs, both VS and SV orders are possible.

In order to model this, we selected the 'free word order' option in the questionaire to gain coverage of all the possible word orders for basic declarative clauses with full Noun Phrases (i.e definite NPs that co-occur with the determiner 'al'). We also chose sentences where the subject NP is singular.
The reason for choosing sentences with definite, singular NPs for the above is because definiteness and person features on NPs constraint the word order possibilities. These are documented below. We allowed our grammar to overgenerate for the purpose of this lab, but developed the tests for these below.

As for the first constraint on word order, when the subject is indefinite (indicated by the absence of 'al'), for transitive clauses, the verb must be sentence-initial. All other orders are ungrammatical. On the other hand, for intransitive clauses with indefinite NP subjects, the verb must be sentence-final.

As for the second constraint on word order, when the pre-verbal subject NP is non-sg, the verb must agree in person with this subject. When the subject is postverbal, the verb must have the singular person feature. This is consistent for both transitive and intransitive clauses.

In order to model this, we chose NPs that have been reported in the sources  in their plural form, and permuted them with the singular/plural forms of words with the various word order possibilities. We maintained the use of definite NPs

#17- VSO



#18- SVO




###############Pronouns########################



############ Case ########################

Modern Standard Arabic has a nominative-accusative alignment case system. The nominative case is indicated by -u while the accusative case is indicated by the suffix -a. 

The subject is marked with "-u/-un”  which is the nominative suffix while the object is marked with the accusative ‘-a/-an’. Having the subject assigned accusative case while the object assigned nominative case render the sentence ungrammatical.
This is consistent for both transitive clauses and intransitive clauses.

In order to model case, we defined nominative and accusative case inflection slots for both singular nouns and plural nouns respectively.  Singular and plural nominal forms are expressed by stem allomorphy, and we chose to develop two different case lexical types that inherits from the singular and plural lexical types. The nominative case marker -u/-un constraints the nominal forms to be in nominative case and expressed as a subject of the main verb, while the accusative case constrains the nominals to be expressed as an object of the verb.

It is also observed that the logical object of the sentence can be expressed in the nominative case, only if the verb has a pronominal suffix. The choice of the suffix has to correspond to the object in terms of person and gender. 
This constraint only applies to word order possibilities where the object is sentence-initial (OSV, OVS).
This pattern expresses topicalization of the object in the sentence. In these two cases, it is not possible for the sentence-initial object to be in accusative case, unless the pronominal -haa is absent, which is parallel with the OSV/OVS order documented previously.

To model this, we created verbs with pronominal suffix -haa and created negative test examples for OVS and OSV orders where the Object is expressed with accusative case in the context of this verb type. We maintained the use of definite subjects for consistency.
We also created negative examples for OVS and OSV orders where the object is nominative in the context of a verb with no pronominal suffix. These are also ungrammatical. We maintained the use of definite subjects for consistency.
